        "Create a multi-panel publication-quality figure (named **Figure 1**) that tells the complete story of your analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Requirements:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Panel Layout**\n",
        "   - Create a figure with 6 panels (2 rows × 3 columns OR 3 rows × 2 columns)\n",
        "   - Each panel should be clearly labeled (A, B, C, D, E, F)\n",
        "   - Use consistent color schemes across panels\n",
        "   - Include a comprehensive figure legend\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Required Panels**:\n",
        "   - **Panel A**: PKMYT1 expression vs. dependency scatter plot (from Part 1.2)\n",
        "   - **Panel B**: PKMYT1 dependency across cancer types (box plot or bar plot from Part 1.3)\n",
        "   - **Panel C**: Volcano plot from one correlation analysis (your choice of best one from Part 2.3)\n",
        "   - **Panel D**: Venn diagram showing overlap of top correlations (from Part 3.2)\n",
        "   - **Panel E**: Top enriched pathways (bar plot from Part 3.3)\n",
        "   - **Panel F**: Heatmap showing expression/dependency of core genes across cancer types (from Part 3.4)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Figure Quality**:\n",
        "   - High resolution (at least 300 DPI)\n",
        "   - Clear, readable labels and legends\n",
        "   - Consistent font sizes\n",
        "   - Professional appearance suitable for publication\n",

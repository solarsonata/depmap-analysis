    "## Integrating Gene Expression and Dependency to Discover Therapeutic Targets\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to use DepMap gene effect and expression data to investigate the gene PKMYT1.\n",
    "PKMYT1 is a cell-cycle kinase that prevents premature Cdk1 activation. It has recently gained attention\n",
    "as a potential cancer target.\n",
    "In this project we want to find out which cancers depend on PKMYT1, and in which cancers is PKMYT1 highly expressed.\n",
    "We will then see how expression and dependency are correlated and if this correlation is statistically significant.\n",
    "In the next stage of the analysis we will find genes that show similar patterns of dependency and expression acrosss all cancer cell lines\n",
    "using correlation analysis. We will check the top 100 correlated genes and investigate them further:\n",
    "How much overlap is there between expression and dependency? What pathways is the gene collection enriched for?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and Quality Control (QC) on complex data sets\n",
    "- Analyze relationships between gene expression and functional dependencies\n",
    "- Implement correlation analyses across multiple data modalities\n",
    "- Integrate multi-omic data to identify therapeutic targets\n",

    "   - Display the first 5 rows of each dataset to verify successful loading\n",

    "### Part 2.2: Multiple Testing Correction\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ The Multiple Testing Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "When testing 18,000 genes at significance level α=0.05, we expect **900 false positives** (18,000 × 0.05)! That is to say that we expect to incorrectly reject the null hypothesis for 900 of the genes! Without correction, your results would be contaminated with hundreds of false discoveries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters in Genomics:**\n",
    "- Testing one hypothesis: p<0.05 means 5% chance of false positive\n",
    "- Testing 18,000 hypotheses: nearly guaranteed to have false positives\n",
    "- **Solution**: Adjust p-values to control false discovery rate (FDR)\n",
    "\n",
    "**False Discovery Rate (FDR):**\n",
    "- FDR < 0.05 means \"at most 5% of my significant results are false positives\"\n",
    "- More appropriate than controlling family-wise error rate (FWER) for exploratory genomics\n",
    "- Less conservative than Bonferroni correction, but maintains statistical rigor\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bonferroni vs. FDR:**\n",
    "- **Bonferroni**: Very conservative, controls probability of ANY false positive\n",
    "  - Adjusted p-value = original p-value × number of tests\n",
    "  - Use when false positives are very costly\n",
    "- **FDR (Benjamini-Hochberg)**: Controls proportion of false positives among discoveries\n",
    "  - Standard in genomics and recommended here\n",
    "  - Better statistical power while maintaining control\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**📌 Important for All Future Analyses:**\n",
    "From now on, when you refer to \"significant\" genes, you MUST use FDR < 0.05, not uncorrected p-values. This is standard practice in genomics.\n",
